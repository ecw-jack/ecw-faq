# Mi-8

## Radio setup
The Mi-8 has two communication radios we care about. The primary radio (R-863) for normal U/VHF and the secondary radio (R-828) for the 30.0 MHz FM channel used by other helicopters.

1. Primary radio pedestal controls:
    - PRESET/MANUAL switch to PRESET
    - Maximise volume
2. Secondary radio controls (on right cockpit wall, next to countermeasures panel):
    - Power switch to ON
3. Use primary radio channel selector on overhead in front of pilot to switch between preset channels
4. Radio selector on overhead in front of your seat:
    - Maximise volumes
    - RADIO/ICS switch to RADIO
    - Choose primary (R-863) or secondary (R-828) radios to transmit on

You may also want to turn on your signal flares (power switches and circuit breaker) and set up binds for the different colour flares, and use them to help friendlies find/ID you, or to give a fireworks display when your door gunner shoots down an F-14 :)
