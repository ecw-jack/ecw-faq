# A-4

ECW uses the [Community A-4 mod](https://github.com/heclak/community-a4e-c)

This is a superb and versatile module, effectively payware-quality (in fact better than some payware modules!)

## Installation

- Download [the latest official A-4E-C release package](https://github.com/heclak/community-a4e-c/releases/). Do not download directly from the Github repository.
- Place the 'Mods\aircraft\A-4E-C' folder in into your Windows user folder's Saved Games folder for DCS, e.g. 'C:\Users\username\Saved Games\DCS'
- If you have installed other DCS World mods, you might already have the 'Mods' and 'aircraft' folders indicated in the file path. If so, merge the new A-4E-C folder into the existing folders.

If you don't have the A-4 mod installed, you will see other players' A-4s as Su-27s.
