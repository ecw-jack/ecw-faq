# About the server

## What is ECW?

ECW is Enigma's Dynamic Cold War Campaign. It is a PVP DCS server and community where Red and Blu players fight for control of the map, sector by sector. Player stats are tracked and can be seen in the Discord server. You can earn points for certain actions and spend them to summon AI support aircraft and unlock advanced aircraft for yourself.

The server uses the [A4 Mod](https://github.com/heclak/community-a4e-c) and no other mods.

The current map status can be seen online [here](https://hex.moelan.net/).

## Mission Statement

> _To provide a fun, competitive and balanced (via parity) multiplayer dynamic campaign in DCS centered around the Cold War setting. Due to holes in the DCS playable aircraft universe, decisions must be made in order to achieve the mission statement. Main pillars are the fundamental truths and must be consulted and adhered to when changes are considered._

### Pillar 1: Fun

> _The first and most important pillar is to ensure that the server remains accessible and fun for players to enjoy. Restrictive mechanics like lives, side locking and fuel refueling will never be part of the server. Mechanics that take away fun or frustrate users are avoided._

### Pillar 2: Competitive Campaign

> _The second pillar is to lean into and encourage a competitive environment. A dynamic campaign where one side eventually wins is the main focus of the campaign. To avoid an airquake scenario, players and mechanics encourage participation in the campaign. Players should feel that their efforts are part of a larger effort._

### Pillar 3: Balance/Parity and Asymmetry

> _Balance/Parity will be achieved while still allowing for asymmetrical fights. The plane sets will be sourced from historical availability to allow for asymmetrical fights but tweaked to ensure that there is parity between sides. Most of this tweaking comes into the availability of what weapons are and are not restricted._
>
> _The priority is: Parity/Balance > Asymmetry > Historical Accuracy_

### Pillar 4: Creative Freedom

> _Creative freedom will be used extensively in order to ensure that balance is there but asymmetry is a must to keep fights interesting. Creative freedom will be used in order to keep things fun and competitive._
