# ECW Community FAQ

This is a community-run FAQ for the Enigma's Cold War DCS server.

It is not the [Official FAQ](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1I-aD-s3zoEpV4gGu7QIrEdywkpklfT40te-mYlX3zk8)
but aims to include all the information from it.

## What's wrong with the Official FAQ?

Nothing except that because it's a Google Drive presentation, you can only link
to the whole thing, not to individual sections. This FAQ can be hosted on
readthedocs.org and gain a contents list and links to section headings for
free. 

## Who made this?

"Jack / Blackbird" from the ECW Discord. Contributions welcome - find me on the ECW Discord or [via GitHub](https://github.com/ecw-jack/ecw-faq/issues)
