# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is TacView supported?

TacView is disabled to save FPS

## Should I make traffic calls on SRS?

No, please don't. Other servers may require it but on ECW it's unnecessary and a
bit irritating. Just look before landing or taxying onto a runway and be
considerate to your teammates. Turning on your landing lights helps you to be
seen.
